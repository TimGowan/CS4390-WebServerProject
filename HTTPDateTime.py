# Description: 
#   a program that outputs the current day/time in HTTP Header format as the output using python native library.
# 
#   Sample Output with HTTP Header Format:           Thu, 19 Feb 2015 18:19:43 CST 
#
# Note: It will NOT determine timezones, defaults to 'CST' string (where the program was written and will be used)
